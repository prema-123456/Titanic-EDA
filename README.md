# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and key factors influencing passenger survival. The analysis emphasizes data understanding, validation, and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
- The dataset contains demographic and travel-related information of passengers aboard the Titanic.

## Tools & Technologies
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Methodology
- Performed initial data inspection to understand structure, data types, and distributions.
- Validated data quality by checking for missing values and inconsistencies.
- Conducted univariate analysis to study individual feature distributions.
- Performed bivariate analysis to examine relationships between passenger attributes and survival outcomes.
- Used statistical summaries and visualizations to support analytical findings.

## Key Insights
- Passenger gender had a significant impact on survival, with females showing higher survival rates.
- Survival probability was strongly influenced by passenger class, favoring first-class travelers.
- Higher ticket fares were associated with increased chances of survival.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights how socio-economic factors and demographics played a critical role in survival outcomes. This project demonstrates a structured approach to exploratory data analysis and effective use of visualization for data-driven insights.
